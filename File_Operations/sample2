Every detail is designed to ensure ultimate performance. The Extreme Carbon shell in 100% carbon fiber guarantees
extraordinary lightness, which makes it effortless to wear. Its shapes and metal air vents are studied in the wind
tunnel and tested by AGV athletes in order to ensure the best aerodynamic penetration and the greatest stability at
high speeds, also due to the innovative profile of the rear PRO Spoiler. Boasting 5 mm thickness, the optical class 1
Ultra vision visor is an integral part of the protector that allows 190° panoramic vision, and 85° vertical vision.
This means the rider sees the track, adversaries, and obstacles more clearly, before anyone else, even in racing
position tucked into the frame.
